        <h1>Chapter 6.4</h1>
        <h1>6.4.1 The 6 V’s of Big Data</h1>
        <p>Data for a company can be vast. In fact, it can be so extensive that companies now refer to it as <strong>Big Data</strong>.</p>
        <p>Due to the sheer size and complexity of Big Data, its quality is categorized into <strong>six V’s</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volume</strong> – The amount of data collected from various sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Variety</strong> – The different types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity</strong> – The speed at which data is generated and processed.</li>
            <li><strong>Veracity</strong> – The degree to which the data can be trusted.</li>
            <li><strong>Value</strong> – The business significance and usefulness of the collected data.</li>
            <li><strong>Variability</strong> – The different ways in which the data can be used and formatted.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Assurance & Quality</h2>
        <p>Ensuring data is accurate and reliable is critical. <strong>Data assurance</strong> includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Validation</strong> – Ensuring data is entered in the correct format.</li>
            <li><strong>Verification</strong> – Checking that data has been accurately recorded.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability</strong> – Ensuring consistency in data collection and usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Redundancy</strong> – Keeping multiple copies of important data to prevent loss.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Types of Data</h2>
        <p>Data comes in different forms, mainly categorized as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Qualitative Data</strong> – Non-numeric, descriptive information gathered through interviews, surveys, or observations.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantitative Data</strong> – Numeric data that can be measured and analyzed statistically, often collected through structured methods such as sensors or databases.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Research Population</h2>
        <p>A <strong>research population</strong> is the total group of individuals from which data is collected. Demographics influence how a population is chosen, impacting data accuracy and relevancy.</p>
        
        <h2>Legislation & Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>Handling data requires compliance with regulations such as GDPR, which ensures data privacy and protection. Ethical considerations include ensuring informed consent, minimizing bias, and protecting data from unauthorized access.</p>
        
        <h2>Organisational Factors</h2>
        <p>Businesses must consider various factors when handling data, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time</strong> – Data collection and analysis can be time-consuming and must be planned efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Skills</strong> – Data management requires expertise in analysis, security, and interpretation.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> – Resources are needed to store, process, and maintain data securely.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>6.4.2 Data Analysis Tools & Business Use</h1>
        <h2>Data Warehousing</h2>
        <p>A <strong>data warehouse</strong> is a structured, centralized repository that integrates data from multiple sources for business intelligence. It provides historical data analysis to support decision-making.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensures data consistency and quality.</li>
            <li>Data is cleaned and structured before storage.</li>
            <li>Used in reporting and trend analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Lakes</h2>
        <p>A <strong>data lake</strong> stores raw, unstructured data. Unlike data warehouses, data is processed only when needed, allowing greater flexibility.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows flexible data processing.</li>
            <li>Can store vast amounts of data in native format.</li>
            <li>Supports artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Mining</h2>
        <p><strong>Data mining</strong> involves analyzing large datasets to identify patterns, trends, and correlations. Businesses use it for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer behavior analysis.</li>
            <li>Market trend prediction.</li>
            <li>Fraud detection and risk management.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Reporting</h2>
        <p>Reports provide visual and textual summaries of analyzed data, helping businesses make informed decisions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be presented as graphs, charts, or dashboards.</li>
            <li>Used to communicate insights effectively within an organization.</li>
            <li>Facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements.</li>
        </ul>
