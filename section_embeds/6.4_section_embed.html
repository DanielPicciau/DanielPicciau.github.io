        <!-- Introduction to Data Wrangling -->
        <h2>What is Data Wrangling?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Data wrangling</strong> (also referred to as data munging) is the process of cleaning,
            organising, and transforming raw data into a format that is more suitable for analysis. 
            Its purpose is to ensure that the data being used is accurate, consistent, and ready 
            for valuable insights. Successful data wrangling involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Identifying and correcting errors, removing duplicates, and handling missing values.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Converting data into a standard format or structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Combining data from different sources into a coherent dataset.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Ensuring data quality and consistency are maintained after changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 6 Vs of Big Data Section -->
        <h2>The 6 Vs of Big Data</h2>
        <p>
            Big Data is often defined by its <strong>6 Vs</strong>. Each V represents a unique aspect 
            that makes managing large datasets both challenging and rewarding. Below is a breakdown of each:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Volume</h3>
        <p>
            Refers to the <em>sheer size</em> of the data collected. For example, social media platforms
            collect billions of posts, likes, and comments every day, creating massive datasets
            that traditional tools struggle to handle.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Velocity</h3>
        <p>
            Describes the <em>speed</em> at which data is generated and needs to be processed. 
            Real-time analytics of streaming sensor data in <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> 
            devices is a prime example.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Variety</h3>
        <p>
            Indicates the <em>different forms</em> of data: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.
            This includes text documents, images, videos, social media posts, and more. 
            A company's CRM data (structured) may be combined with social media feeds (unstructured).
        </p>

        <h3>4. Veracity</h3>
        <p>
            Reflects the <em>trustworthiness</em> and quality of the data. 
            Not all data sources are reliable; inaccurate or biased data leads to poor insights 
            and flawed decision-making.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Value</h3>
        <p>
            The <em>usefulness</em> of the data in generating insights and guiding strategic decisions. 
            Data is only valuable if it can be transformed into actionable information—such as 
            identifying new market opportunities or improving operational efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Variability</h3>
        <p>
            Represents the <em>inconsistency</em> in data structure or meaning over time. 
            For instance, the way people discuss products on social media may vary drastically, 
            using slang or new terms as language evolves.
        </p>

        <!-- How Data Wrangling Addresses the 6 Vs -->
        <h2>How Data Wrangling Helps Overcome the 6 Vs</h2>
        <p>
            Data wrangling is crucial in managing Big Data effectively. Here’s how it addresses 
            the challenges posed by the 6 Vs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Managing Volume:</strong> Through scalable solutions that clean and transform large datasets in distributed environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Controlling Velocity:</strong> Automating data cleaning and integration processes so that high-speed data streams remain accurate.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling Variety:</strong> Providing methods to convert and merge structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data into uniform formats.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving Veracity:</strong> Implementing checks and validations to ensure data quality, filtering out unreliable data sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhancing Value:</strong> Delivering refined datasets that enable more accurate analyses, leading to valuable insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Dealing with Variability:</strong> Continuously updating data transformation rules to handle evolving data structures and formats.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Optional: Tools & Technologies -->
        <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Although not mandatory, familiarity with modern data wrangling tools can simplify 
            many tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python Libraries:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, and Dask for cleaning and transforming data.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL:</strong> For querying and aggregating data in relational databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Apache Spark:</strong> Handles massive datasets efficiently through distributed computing.</li>
        </ul>
