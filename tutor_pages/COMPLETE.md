# Guide to Pseudocode for T-Level Digital Production, Design & Development

Pseudocode is a structured method of describing algorithms using simple, language-independent syntax. It is not a programming language, but it follows logical conventions similar to many high-level languages.

This guide covers:
- Data Types
- Variables and Arrays
- Selection (IF statements)
- Loops (Iteration)
- Functions & Procedures
- Input & Output
- File Handling
- Operators (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical)
- Comments & Best Practices
- Advanced Examples

---

## 1. Introduction

Pseudocode is a structured way of describing algorithms without committing to the syntax of a specific programming language. Use pseudocode to plan or communicate the steps needed to solve a problem.

---

## 2. Data Types

- **STRING**: “Hello”, “123”
- **CHARACTER**: ‘A’, ‘B’
- **INTEGER**: 5, -100
- **REAL/FLOAT**: 3.14, -2.71
- **BOOLEAN**: TRUE, FALSE

SET Name TO ‘Daniel’
SET Age TO 18
SET Pi TO 3.14159
SET IsStudent TO TRUE

*Example of declaring variables of different data types.*

---

## 3. Variables & Arrays

### 3.1 Assigning Variables

SET Score TO 10
SET Message TO ‘Hello’

Use `SET` keyword to assign or reassign a value. Choose descriptive variable names.

### 3.2 Arrays

SET Numbers TO [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
SET Names TO [‘Alice’, ‘Bob’, ‘Charlie’]

Arrays store multiple values under a single variable name.

### 3.3 Accessing Arrays

SET FirstNumber TO Numbers[0]    # Retrieves the first element (1)
SET LastName TO Names[2]        # Retrieves ‘Charlie’

Indexing typically starts at 0, but follow the specified convention.

---

## 4. Selection (IF Statements)

### 4.1 Basic IF Statement

IF Age >= 18 THEN
SEND ‘You are an adult’ TO DISPLAY
END IF

### 4.2 IF-ELSE Statement

IF Age >= 18 THEN
SEND ‘You can vote’ TO DISPLAY
ELSE
SEND ‘You are too young to vote’ TO DISPLAY
END IF

### 4.3 Nested IF Statements (Advanced)

IF Age >= 18 THEN
IF Age >= 65 THEN
SEND ‘You are a senior citizen’ TO DISPLAY
ELSE
SEND ‘You are an adult, but not a senior’ TO DISPLAY
END IF
ELSE
SEND ‘You are a minor’ TO DISPLAY
END IF

---

## 5. Loops (Iteration)

### 5.1 WHILE Loop

SET Counter TO 0
WHILE Counter < 5 DO
SEND Counter TO DISPLAY
SET Counter TO Counter + 1
END WHILE

Use `WHILE` loops when the number of iterations depends on a condition.

### 5.2 FOR Loop

FOR Index FROM 1 TO 5 DO
SEND Index TO DISPLAY
END FOR

Use `FOR` loops when the number of iterations is known in advance.

### 5.3 REPEAT-UNTIL Loop

SET Number TO 0
REPEAT
SEND ‘Processing…’ TO DISPLAY
SET Number TO Number + 1
UNTIL Number = 3

### 5.4 Nested Loops (Advanced)

FOR i FROM 0 TO 2 DO
FOR j FROM 0 TO 2 DO
SEND “i=” & i & “, j=” & j TO DISPLAY
END FOR
END FOR

---

## 6. Functions & Procedures

### 6.1 Function

FUNCTION Square(Number)
BEGIN FUNCTION
RETURN Number * Number
END FUNCTION

A function returns a value.

### 6.2 Procedure

PROCEDURE Greet(Name)
BEGIN PROCEDURE
SEND ’Hello, ’ & Name TO DISPLAY
END PROCEDURE

A procedure performs a task but does not return a value.

### 6.3 Passing Arrays to Functions or Procedures (Advanced)

FUNCTION GetSum(Numbers)
BEGIN FUNCTION
SET Total TO 0
FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(Numbers) - 1 DO
SET Total TO Total + Numbers[i]
END FOR
RETURN Total
END FUNCTION

SET MyNumbers TO [10, 20, 30]
SET SumOfNumbers TO GetSum(MyNumbers)   # 60

---

## 7. Input & Output

### 7.1 Reading Input

SEND ‘Enter your name:’ TO DISPLAY

RECEIVE UserName FROM (STRING) KEYBOARD

SEND ‘Enter your age:’ TO DISPLAY

RECEIVE Age FROM (INTEGER) KEYBOARD

### 7.2 Displaying Output

SEND ’Welcome, ’ & UserName TO DISPLAY

---

## 8. File Handling

### 8.1 Reading a File

READ MyFile.txt Data

### 8.2 Writing to a File

WRITE MyFile.txt ‘Hello World’

### 8.3 Advanced File Handling

OPEN MyFile.txt FOR READ
WHILE NOT EOF(MyFile.txt) DO
READ LINE FromFile
SEND FromFile TO DISPLAY
END WHILE
CLOSE MyFile.txt



OPEN MyFile.txt FOR APPEND
WRITE LINE ‘Appending this text.’
CLOSE MyFile.txt

## 9. Operators

### 9.1 Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description         |
|----------|---------------------|
| +        | Addition            |
| -        | Subtraction         |
| *        | Multiplication      |
| /        | Division            |
| ^        | Exponent            |
| MOD      | Modulo (Remainder)  |
| DIV      | Integer Division    |

SET x TO 10
SET y TO 3
SET sum TO x + y              # sum = 13
SET remainder TO x MOD y      # remainder = 1
SET power TO x ^ y            # power = 1000 (10^3)

### 9.2 Relational Operators

| Operator | Description                |
|----------|----------------------------|
| =        | Equal to                  |
| <>       | Not equal to              |
| >        | Greater than              |
| <        | Less than                 |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to  |
| <=       | Less than or equal to     |

### 9.3 Logical Operators

| Operator | Description                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| AND      | Both conditions must be true             |
| OR       | At least one condition must be true      |
| NOT      | Reverses the condition                   |

IF (Age >= 18) AND (Age < 65) THEN
SEND ‘Adult but not senior’ TO DISPLAY
END IF

IF (Weather = ‘Sunny’) OR (Day = ‘Sunday’) THEN
SEND ‘Go for a walk’ TO DISPLAY
END IF

IF NOT (Score > 50) THEN
SEND ‘Score must be 51 or higher’ TO DISPLAY
END IF

---

## 10. Comments & Best Practices

- **Comments**: Explain logic using comments:

This is a comment

COMMENT Another way to comment

- **Meaningful Names**: Choose names that reflect purpose (e.g. `TotalPrice`, `StudentCount`).
- **Indentation**: Keep code blocks clear and consistent.
- **Modularity**: Break large problems into functions or procedures.
- **Consistency**: Stick to the same conventions for loops, naming, and style.

## 11. Example Question & Answer

**Question**

> Write a pseudocode program that asks the user for their age and checks if they are eligible to vote (18 or older). If they are eligible, display "You can vote"; otherwise, display "You cannot vote."

**Answer**

SEND ‘Enter your age:’ TO DISPLAY
RECEIVE Age FROM (INTEGER) KEYBOARD

IF Age >= 18 THEN
SEND ‘You can vote’ TO DISPLAY
ELSE
SEND ‘You cannot vote’ TO DISPLAY
END IF

---

## 12. Advanced Example

Below is a more advanced example that combines multiple concepts (arrays, loops, functions, and IF statements).

**Scenario**
- Read *3* test scores from the user into an array.
- Validate each score is between `0` and `100`.
- Calculate the average score using a function.
- Display the average and a message indicating if the average is pass or fail (pass if average >= 50).

PROCEDURE Main()
BEGIN PROCEDURE

SET Scores TO [0, 0, 0]         # Create an array of 3 elements
FOR i FROM 0 TO 2 DO
    SEND 'Enter score ' & (i+1) & ' (0-100):' TO DISPLAY
    RECEIVE TempScore FROM (INTEGER) KEYBOARD

    # Validate input
    WHILE TempScore < 0 OR TempScore > 100 DO
        SEND 'Invalid score. Please enter a value between 0 and 100:' TO DISPLAY
        RECEIVE TempScore FROM (INTEGER) KEYBOARD
    END WHILE

    SET Scores[i] TO TempScore
END FOR

# Calculate average using a function
SET AverageScore TO CalculateAverage(Scores)

# Display the average
SEND 'Average score is: ' & AverageScore TO DISPLAY

# Decide pass/fail
IF AverageScore >= 50 THEN
    SEND 'You have passed!' TO DISPLAY
ELSE
    SEND 'You have failed.' TO DISPLAY
END IF

END PROCEDURE

FUNCTION CalculateAverage(ScoresArray)
BEGIN FUNCTION
SET Sum TO 0
FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(ScoresArray) - 1 DO
SET Sum TO Sum + ScoresArray[i]
END FOR

SET Average TO Sum / LENGTH(ScoresArray)
RETURN Average

END FUNCTION

Start the main procedure

CALL Main()

*This advanced example demonstrates array usage, loops, validation, a function to calculate an average, and an IF statement to determine pass/fail.*

## Conclusion

Pseudocode allows you to plan and communicate your algorithms in a clear, language-neutral way. By mastering the use of variables, arrays, selection statements, loops, functions, procedures, and operators, you can break down and solve complex problems systematically. Always remember to comment effectively, use meaningful names, and keep your pseudocode consistent and readable.

**Good luck with your T-Level Digital Production, Design & Development studies!**
